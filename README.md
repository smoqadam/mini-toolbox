## Technical Details

### What You Need
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No internet connection required after downloading
- No installation needed

### How It Works
- Uses HTML5 localStorage to save data
- Each tab gets its own storage space
- Canvas drawings are saved as images
- Text and todos are saved as JSON

### File Structure
```
ddraw/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main browser interface
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # Tab management and storage
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # This file
â””â”€â”€ apps/
    â”œâ”€â”€ draw/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html  # Drawing app
    â”œâ”€â”€ notes/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html  # Notes app
    â””â”€â”€ todos/
        â””â”€â”€ index.html  # Todo app
```

### Storage
- All data is stored in your browser's localStorage
- Each tab has its own data space
- Data persists between browser sessions
- No data is sent to any server

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers:
- âœ… Chrome
- âœ… Firefox  
- âœ… Safari
- âœ… Edge

## Privacy

- Everything stays on your computer
- No data is sent anywhere
- No tracking or analytics
- No internet connection needed

## Limitations

- Storage is limited by your browser (usually 5-10MB)
- Data only exists on one computer/browser
- No sync between devices
- Clearing browser data will delete everything

## Tips

- Use different tabs for different projects
- Your work saves automatically, but you can also close tabs safely
- If you need more space, try clearing old drawings or notes
- Each tab works independently

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing saves**: Check if your browser allows localStorage
**Tabs don't work**: Make sure JavaScript is enabled
**Apps don't load**: Check that all files are in the right folders
**Drawing is slow**: Try using a smaller brush size
